# ActiveCampaign
This code when ran on command line, will prompt the user to type in a client ID by asking “Please enter client ID to view their first name, last name, email, and phone number...” Entering a client ID will search the client ID in ActiveCampaign and return that information. It connects via the API using my trial API key.  Example in README.md.
